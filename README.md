# etoro-trading-api

The plan is to create secure, relibale interface to perform various kinds of trading automation like manualy
coping of traders portfolios, collecting and analysis stock information, and finaly automated trading itself.

This bot will be partlly based on Browser Automation tools because etoro doesnt provide any open
trading API.

At this moment the only supported Browser is Google chrome v58.
You can use it on Linux or Mac OS in couple with Selenium Webdriver which is available in the project
